# SCRAPN - Tournament Draw Web Application

A lightweight tournament draw creation web application! Essentially you create a Tournament Series which acts as an event to house the tournaments contained within the event. At which point you may make multiple tournament draws (single-elimination up to 64 teams and round-robin up to 6 teams) in both singles and doubles. The draws are created and in the case of round robin, the matches are pre-determined.

This utility of this project is to create a platform allowing individuals or organizations running a competition, the ability to create tournament draws, update draws, and display draws online.
